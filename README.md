# Ecoverse
Ecoverse is a program which provides information about reducing, reusing and recycling various types of waste. The program will allow users to log in to the program to be directed to the home page, which allows users to read information about reducing, reusing and recycling and participate in various events and workshops to help save the planet, such as beach clean-ups. These events will be hosted by the admins of Ecoverse, which users can join by signing up. Admins also log in to access the administrative aspects of the program, such as hosting events, recording who participated in which event(s) and updating user points. Admins may also access the user home page but only after logging into their admin home page. They will be able to give donations as an admin but cannot sign up for events since the admins themselves are the organizers.
